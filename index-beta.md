      <h1>We're Hiring</h1>
      <p>
        Subscale is a <b>well funded remote-first</b> company reinventing <b>rapid manufacturing of precision parts</b>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When a production system is down, blah blah. Working here you will solve challenging problems that have never been solved before, with the autonomy to use whatever methods you think best.

        <h3>Simulation Engineers</h3>
        <p>Good simulation is the foundation for intelligent manufacturing. Build the best simulation in the industry, with performance to test millions of scenarios. Find the perfect balance between accuracy and speed. Multidisciplinary background a must, video game developers welcome. </p><p>Passionate about two or more of the following:</p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>Computational geometry</li>
          <li>Physics equations and mesher, elastostatics/dynamics</li>
          <li>Floating point error bound analysis</li>
          <li>Sensor data integration (motor torques, forces, acceleration, position, etc)</li>
          <li>C++ and CUDA experience</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Optimization Engineers</h3>
        <p>Optimize tasks within the constraints provided by the simulator. First do no harm: bad plans can damage the product or equipment. Over time, improve tolerances and reduce costs by a few percent every month forever. </p><p>You choose the method, we just want results.<br> Some areas:</p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>Machine Learning</li>
          <li>Convex Optimization</li>
          <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Automation Engineers</h3>
        <p>Material handling, assembly, and fabrication challenges. Quantity one automation requires a whole new mindset based on computer vision and sensors, including failsafes at every step. Rapid timelines means it’s faster to hack ordinary machines than to order specialized automated systems, despite the custom mechanical, electrical, and software. Creativity is the most valuable component of any design.</p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>Machine vision</li>
          <li>Mechanical engineering</li>
          <li>Networking and microcontrollers</li>
          <li>Closed loop control</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Full Stack Engineers</h3>
        <p>Build the factory management system integrated with the customer website. Graphics background a plus. User interface challenges include GD&T. Transparency and product quality and the guiding principles, standards such ISO/AS/ITAR a must.</p>
